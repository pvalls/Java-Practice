# Java Practice

> Project in Java to practice OOP, inheritance and GUIs.

####  About
This is a practical assignment that was completed in 2017 for educational purposes. The exercise consisted in the creation of a GUI application that emulated a basic video-game scheme with randomy placed agents going towards randomly assigned dot targets and with interactions between agents and obstacles.

#### Running the source code

The provided code is in the form of an Apache NetBeans IDE Java Project, and it is recommended to use this environemnt to edit and build the project.

To run the code simply:
1. Install the [Apache NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/) (the last performed build was on Netbeans 11.1).
2. Clone this repository on any directory
>```javascript
> $ git clone https://github.com/pvalls/java-practice
4. Open the project on NetBeans (File → Open Project)
5. Click the Run Button on NetBeans (▶️)

#### Project description and GUI Screenshot

The task revolves around the design and implementation of classes following an object oriented programing approach. The main developed tasks are:
* Creating a main window.
* JButton for time steps to update the world state.
* Implementing a shape hierarchy as well as graphics and drawing shape methods.
* Implement entities which can be moving agents or randomly shaped obstacles. Triange agents move and steer towards their target (black dot). When an agent reaches a black dot, it shoots a projectile (blue moving dots) and a new random target is assigned.
* Implementing randomly positioned and shaped obstacles.
* Physical interactions (e.g collisions, agents steer over time in the 2D canvas). Objects turn red when they overlap.

* Triange agents move and steer towards their target (black dot).
* When an agent reaches a black dot, it shoots a projectile (blue moving dots) and a new random target is assigned.
* There are randomly shaped and placed obstacles.
* Objects turn red when they overlap.
* Time step JButton to update the world state.
