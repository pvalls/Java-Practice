# Java Practice

### Exercise in Java to practice OOP, inheritance and GUIs

This is a practical exercise that I completed in 2017 for educational purposes. The project consisted in the creation of a GUI application that emulated a video-game basic dynamics and scheme.

The task revolves around the design and implementation of:
* A main window.
* Jbuttons.
* Graphics and drawing methods.
* A shape hierarchy.
* Entities which can be moving agents or obstacles.
* Physical interactions (e.g collisions).
* Timely based updates of the world.
* etc.

See the instructions pdf document in the repository and source code comments for further insights on the exercise and our implementation of the solution.
