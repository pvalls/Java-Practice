# Java Practice

### Exercise in Java to practice OOP, inheritance and GUIs.

This is a practical assignment that was completed in 2017 for educational purposes. The exercise consisted in the creation of a GUI application that emulated a basic video-game scheme with randomy placed agents going towards randomly assigned dot targets and with interactions between agents and obstacles.

The task revolves around the design and implementation of classes following an object oriented programing approach:
* A main window.
* Jbutton for time steps.
* Graphics and drawing methods.
* A shape hierarchy.
* Random generation of entities which can be moving agents that follow targets or randomly shaped obstacles.
* Physical interactions (e.g collisions, agents realistic turns over the 2D canvas).
* Timely based updates of the world.
* etc.

See the instructions pdf document in the repository and the source code comments for further insights on the exercise demands and our implementation of the solution.

### Running the source code

The provided code is in the form of a Apache NetBeansIDE Java Project, and it is recommended to use this environemnt to run and play around with it.

Therefore, to run the code simply:
1. Install Apache NetNeans (the last performed build was done on Netbeans 11.1)
2. Open the project (File + Open Project)
3. Click the Run Button (▶️)
